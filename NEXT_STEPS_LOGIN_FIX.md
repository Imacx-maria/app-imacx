# Next Steps: Resolving Login Issue

## Current Status: SECURITY GUARDS IN PLACE

The application now has runtime security guards that:
- ✅ Force the correct Supabase project (`bnfixjkjrbfalgcqhzof`)
- ✅ Verify JWT tokens match expected project
- ✅ Throw errors if wrong credentials are detected
- ✅ Log all security events

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Step 1: Close All Terminals
**Close every PowerShell/CMD window** you have open. Environment variables persist in sessions.

### Step 2: Open Fresh PowerShell (As Administrator Recommended)
1. Right-click PowerShell → "Run as Administrator" (recommended)
2. Navigate to project:
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Users\maria\Desktop\Imacx\IMACX_PROD\NOVO\imacx\NEW-APP\imacx-clean"
   ```

### Step 3: Use Clean Startup Script
```powershell
.\start_clean.bat
```

This script will:
- Clear any lingering environment variables
- Verify environment is clean
- Run verification script
- Start dev server with correct configuration

### Step 4: Verify Environment
Open browser to: **http://localhost:3000/debug**

**Expected output:**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL:
https://bnfixjkjrbfalgcqhzof.supabase.co ✅

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY:
✅ Present (eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...)

Environment Status:
✅ All variables loaded
```

**If still showing `ocajcjdlrmbmfiirxndn`:**
- STOP the server immediately
- Read "Alternative Solution" section below

### Step 5: Test Login
1. Go to: **http://localhost:3000/login**
2. **Look at browser console** (F12) - should see:
   ```
   ✅ Supabase client verified for project: bnfixjkjrbfalgcqhzof
   ```
3. Enter your **correct Supabase credentials** for the `bnfixjkjrbfalgcqhzof` project
4. Click "Entrar"

**If it says "SECURITY: Supabase key is for wrong project!":**
- This means the `.env.local` ANON_KEY is for the wrong project
- You need to get the correct ANON_KEY from your Supabase dashboard

---

## Alternative Solution: If Problem Persists

### Option A: Get Correct Credentials from Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com
2. Select project: `bnfixjkjrbfalgcqhzof`
3. Go to Settings → API
4. Copy:
   - Project URL
   - anon public key
   - service_role key

5. Update `.env.local` with these exact values

### Option B: Fresh Environment Setup

If the issue persists, there might be deep environment contamination:

```powershell
# 1. Delete .env.local completely
Remove-Item .env.local

# 2. Create fresh .env.local from Supabase dashboard values
# Copy .env.example to .env.local and update with correct values

# 3. Verify the file
node scripts/decode_env_jwt.js

# 4. Restart in clean session
.\start_clean.bat
```

## Verifying You Have the Right Credentials

### Check Your Supabase Dashboard

1. **Login to Supabase**: https://app.supabase.com
2. **Find the correct project** - Look for project name/description that matches IMACX
3. **Verify Project ID** in the URL: `app.supabase.com/project/[PROJECT_ID]/...`
4. **This Project ID MUST be**: `bnfixjkjrbfalgcqhzof`

### If You Have Different Credentials

**IMPORTANT:** If you need to use the `ocajcjdlrmbmfiirxndn` project instead:

1. Edit `utils/supabase.ts`
2. Change:
   ```typescript
   const EXPECTED_PROJECT_ID = 'bnfixjkjrbfalgcqhzof'
   ```
   To:
   ```typescript
   const EXPECTED_PROJECT_ID = 'ocajcjdlrmbmfiirxndn'
   ```

3. Update `.env.local` with correct credentials for that project
4. Restart server

**BUT FIRST:** Confirm with your team which project should be used!

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Confirmed which Supabase project is correct for this application
- [ ] Got fresh credentials from Supabase dashboard
- [ ] Updated `.env.local` with correct values
- [ ] Ran `start_clean.bat` in fresh PowerShell session
- [ ] Verified `/debug` page shows correct project
- [ ] Browser console shows "✅ Supabase client verified for project"
- [ ] Login works with correct credentials
- [ ] Documented which credentials belong to which client

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "SECURITY: Supabase key is for wrong project!"
**Cause:** The ANON_KEY in `.env.local` doesn't match the expected project  
**Fix:** Get correct ANON_KEY from Supabase dashboard for project `bnfixjkjrbfalgcqhzof`

### Error: "Invalid login credentials"
**Cause:** Using wrong username/password for the Supabase project  
**Fix:** Use credentials that exist in the **bnfixjkjrbfalgcqhzof** project, not another project

### Debug page still shows wrong project
**Cause:** Environment variables still contaminated  
**Fix:**
1. Close ALL terminals
2. Reboot computer (nuclear option but guaranteed to work)
3. Open fresh PowerShell after reboot
4. Run `start_clean.bat`

## Files Created for Debugging

- `scripts/verify_env.js` - Check what environment variables are loaded
- `scripts/decode_env_jwt.js` - Decode JWT to see which project it's for
- `start_clean.bat` - Clean startup script
- `SECURITY_INCIDENT_REPORT.md` - Full investigation details

---

## Support

If you're still having issues after following these steps:

1. Run: `node scripts/verify_env.js`
2. Run: `node scripts/decode_env_jwt.js`
3. Take screenshots of both outputs
4. Check `SECURITY_INCIDENT_REPORT.md` for more details

**Remember:** The security guards are now in place. If the wrong project credentials somehow get loaded, the application will **refuse to start** and show a clear error message. This is by design to protect your data.
