   - All components ready

### Known Issue: PostgREST Schema Cache

The tables exist in PostgreSQL but Supabase's REST API (PostgREST) is showing "table not found" error. This is because:

**Root Cause:** Tables were created via direct PostgreSQL connection, and PostgREST's schema cache hasn't refreshed yet.

**Resolution:** This is temporary and should resolve within 5-10 minutes as Supabase automatically refreshes the schema cache.

**If Still Having Issues After 10 Minutes:**

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://app.supabase.com
2. Navigate to the project
3. Click on "Database" > "Tables"
4. Verify `profiles`, `roles`, and `role_permissions` tables are visible
5. If still not visible, restart the PostgREST service from the Supabase dashboard

### Testing the Login

1. Open http://localhost:3003/login
2. Enter credentials:
   - Email: `test@imacx.pt`
   - Password: `Test123!@#`
3. You should be redirected to `/dashboard`

### If Login Still Fails

**Common Issues and Solutions:**

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Table not found" error | Wait 5-10 minutes for Supabase cache refresh, then reload page |
| "Invalid credentials" | Check email/password are exactly as above |
| Still on login page | Clear browser cache and cookies, try in incognito mode |
| 500 error | Check browser console for details, verify .env.local is correct |

### Next Steps

1. Test login with provided credentials
2. Once working, create additional users via the admin panel at `/definicoes/utilizadores`
3. Test user creation, editing, and deletion
4. Assign roles to users

### Technical Details

- **Auth Table:** `auth.users` (Supabase managed)
- **User Profiles:** `profiles` table with columns:
  - `user_id` (FK to auth.users)
  - `first_name`, `last_name`
  - `email`, `phone`, `notes`
  - `role_id` (FK to roles)
  - `active` (boolean)
  - Timestamps

- **Roles:** `roles` table with:
  - `id`, `name`, `description`
  - 7 existing roles

- **Permissions:** `role_permissions` table for role-based access control

### Troubleshooting Script

Run this to check current status:
```bash
node scripts/check_profiles_access.js
```

This will verify:
- Table accessibility
- Login functionality
- Data access after authentication

### Development Notes

- All user management components located in `/app/definicoes/utilizadores`
- Form component: `/components/forms/CreateUserForm.tsx`
- List component: `/components/UsersList.tsx`
- Utilities: `/utils/userManagement.ts`
- Scripts for debugging in `/scripts/` directory
